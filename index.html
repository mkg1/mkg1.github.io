													<h2 class="resume">Hello there! I'm Molly.</h2>
												</header>
												<p>I'm a developer with 5+ years experience of back-end and front-end work. In my current role, I primarily work in back-end technologies but outside of work, I have dabbled in (and am actively learning) a handful of front-end tools as well. </p>
												<p>I got my start with programming after attending a 12-week immersive coding bootcamp. I started out with a career in Public Health after earning a degree from UNC Chapel Hill (Go Heels!) but found that at work, I was constantly pestering the developers in the office next to me to let me help them work on whatever cool app or website they were building. I quickly realized I'd missed my calling and signed up for bootcamp and badabing badaboom! Here I am! I love what I do and remain eager to learn and grow as a developer.</p>
												<p>When I'm not nerding out over code, you can find me with a barbell in my hands (aspiring powerlifter over here) or studying for the next step in obtaining my hang gliding pilot license. </p>

										<h3>Duke University</h3>
										<p>I currently work for Duke University's Research Application Development (RAD) team. In a university setting, where acronyms are abundant, I'm proud to belong to the RAD-est. My team supports a suite of ~10 custom-built apps supporting research compliance at Duke.</p>
										<p>Our customers (compliance offices for the University and School of Medicine) require specific reporting and tracking tools for their business operations. We work with our customers to build the tools they need and provide technical and user support when needed.</p>
										<p class="last">Most of our apps use a Rails back-end and various javascript/front-end frameworks. Recently, we've been in the process of upgrading our apps to more current technologies, using Rails 5 and new front-end frameworks. I've been able to hone front-end skills through work with React, Bootstrap, and Materialize in some of our apps. </p>

										<p>I recently volunteered to teach a class through Duke's Innovation Co-Lab on "Data Manipulation Using SQL". The class was open to all students and staff and was intended to be a primer on database design and the basics of querying and manipulating data.</p>

										<h3>Glitteratti Gang</h3>
										<p>Side project I'm currently working on for Glitteratti Gang of NYC. This fun site is allowing me to veer from my usual back-end developer role and try my hand at some front-end design work and mobile development.</p>
										<p>For this app, I opted to go with Laravel and Vue.js. The app is still under development as I take my time learning two new technologies.</p>
										<p class="last">Keep an eye out for the Glitteratti Gang, sprinkling a little sparkle at parties and flea markets around NYC!</p>

										<p>Upwards of 2000 tons of food intended for consumption are wasted each day in North Carolina alone! The goal of foostream is to eliminate this excessive food waste problem, and not just in NC. As the slogan indicates, foodstream is an app for people who believe edible food should be eaten. </p>
										<p>foodstream was developed as a final project for The Iron Yard. The app targets primarily institutional users who have excess, unmarketable food that is still edible. The app creates a platform where users can offer this excess food and other individuals can claim it.</p>
										<p class="last">As a back-end developer for the project, I helped build in several key features aimed at enhancing user-friendliness: 1) built-in messaging feature that sends a corresponding email for each message sent, 2) map directions via Google Maps integration, and 3) calendar reminders for the food that's been claimed via iCal integration.</p>

										<p>In my spare time, I've recently been delving into some hardware programming and trying my hand at programming various IOT devices and learning about circuits.</p>
										<p class="last">Work in progress: currently attempting to build a Dance Dance Revolution-style alarm clock (that would only stop once a certain dance pattern is completed). Work in progress! </p>

										<p>MyHealthStyle is an app that takes a holistic approach to helping users reach their health goals through positive behavior change. I did some free-lance work on the app while it was in the start-up phase.</p>
										<p class="last">The app was built primarily using Rails and as one of the developers spinning up the initial prototype, I was tasked with selecting and integrating technologies that would support the various features required for customers to interact with health coaches and customer support. This included: texting capabilities, a chat feature, customer support chat, and a shopping cart/payment feature. </p>

									<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
										<p class="last">Culture Shock is the result of a weekend assignment for The Iron Yard. The app allows users to specify a region of the world and in return, they are provided a recipe and a playlist from that region, creating a unique cultural experience. The app accomplishes this by consuming two APIs.</p>

										<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
										<p>In addition to my day job as a back-end engineer, I also like to give my right brain a bit of exercise by reviewing websites for design and usability. I've completed over 250 usability tests for various apps and websites.</p>
										<p class="last">The usability tests I've completed cover products in all different stages of the development lifecycle. I've reviewed everything from wireframes to beginning-stage prototypes to apps already in production. Reviewing sites/apps has given me a better understanding of what constitutes good design and how important a good user experience to a product's success.</p>
