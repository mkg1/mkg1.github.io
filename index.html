											<p>Welcome to my site! I’m a full-stack software engineer, explorer, and life-long learner, among other things. I have experience developing apps for both large, established research institutions and small, speedy startups, as well as serving as a technical co-founder. As a former public health student turned software engineer, I am inspired to create products that make the world a better place, both for people and our environment.</p>

										<h3>Random Teleport</h3>
										<p>Freelance project for a client who came to me with an idea of creating a website where users could explore and connect with random interest groups while also providing more visibility for those groups. The app is built using Sveltekit and gives users the ability to "teleport" to a random community (think Discord or Slack). Users can also add info about their own community to be stored in the Firebase back-end which will then be shown at random to other "teleporters".</p>

										<h3>Explain Like I'm Human</h3>
										<p>After a particularly rocky switch to a new team that used languages and tools I was relatively unfamiliar with, I decided to start a blog (said everyone and their grandma!) to document the things I struggled with. For the topics I was learning, I'd been finding it particularly difficult to identify learning resources that dealt with technical concepts at the right level of abstraction for someone like me who was not a complete programming beginner but also not a technical whiz kid. My blog attemtps to occupy that liminal space between hyper-specific technical examples and super-high level, conceptual jargon.</p>

										<h3>Plastic Raindrop</h3>
										<p>We have a plastic problem on the planet. We are all aware of it to some degree, and yet we continue to generate and use plastic at an unsustainable rate. After reading an article stating that rainwater is no longer safe to drink anywhere on the planet as a result of microplastic infiltration, I was inspired to create Plastic Raindrop. The site offers guidance for consumers moving away from plastic usage and reviews plastic-free products.</p>

The app created a platform where users could offer their excess food and other individuals could claim it.</p>

										<h3>Usability Testing</h3>

I've reviewed everything from wireframes to beginning-stage prototypes to apps already in production. Reviewing sites/apps has given me a better understanding of what constitutes good design and how important a solid user experience is to a product's success.</p>
